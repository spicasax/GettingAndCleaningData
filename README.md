## How to run the script

1. Clone download the zip of this repo to your computer.
2. In your R console, set your working directory to the directory you've downloaded the file. E.g., ```setwd(yourdirectoryhere)```. This will do a one-time download of the required data file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it.
3. In your R console, run the ```run_analysis.R``` file. E.g., ```source run_analysis.R```
4. The ```run_analysis.R``` creates two data files in the working directory: ```tidy1.csv``` and ```tidy2.csv```. Please see the [CodeBook](https://github.com/spicasax/GettingAndCleaningData/blob/master/CodeBook.md) for more details.
